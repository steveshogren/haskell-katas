Obscurest night involv'd the sky,
Th' Atlantic billows roar'd,
   -> 56
 
And ever, as the minutes flew,
Entreated help, or cried--Adieu!
   -> 84
 
Nor ever ship left Albion's coast,
With warmer wishes sent.
   -> 112
 
To give the melancholy theme
A more enduring date:
   -> 48
 
He shouted: nor his friends had fail'd
To check the vessel's course,
   -> 24
 
But so the furious blast prevail'd,
That, pitiless perforce,
   -> 68
 
Had heard his voice in ev'ry blast,
Could catch the sound no more.
   -> 44
 
And so long he, with unspent pow'r,
His destiny repell'd;
   -> 8
 
But he (they knew) nor ship, nor shore,
Whate'er they gave, should visit more.
   -> 76
 
And tears by bards or heroes shed
Alike immortalize the dead.
   -> 100
 
For then, by toil subdued, he drank
The stifling wave, and then he sank.
   -> 52
 
But misery still delights to trace
Its semblance in another's case.
   -> 88
 
No poet wept him: but the page
Of narrative sincere;
   -> 120
 
When such a destin'd wretch as I,
Wash'd headlong from on board,
   -> 80
 
But I beneath a rougher sea,
And whelm'd in deeper gulfs than he.
   -> 0
 
Not long beneath the whelming brine,
Expert to swim, he lay;
   -> 128
 
They left their outcast mate behind,
And scudded still before the wind.
   -> 124
 
Yet bitter felt it still to die
Deserted, and his friends so nigh.
   -> 104
 
Nor, cruel as it seem'd, could he
Their haste himself condemn,
   -> 108
 
Of friends, of hope, of all bereft,
His floating home for ever left.
   -> 92
 
At length, his transient respite past,
His comrades, who before
   -> 28
 
No voice divine the storm allay'd,
No light propitious shone;
   -> 96
 
No braver chief could Albion boast
Than he with whom he went,
   -> 12
 
When, snatch'd from all effectual aid,
We perish'd, each alone:
   -> 60
 
I therefore purpose not, or dream,
Descanting on his fate,
   -> 16
 
He long survives, who lives an hour
In ocean, self-upheld;
   -> 32
 
Aware that flight, in such a sea,
Alone could rescue them;
   -> 72
 
He lov'd them both, but both in vain,
Nor him beheld, nor her again.
   -> 64
 
But wag'd with death a lasting strife,
Supported by despair of life.
   -> 20
 
That tells his name, his worth, his age,
Is wet with Anson's tear.
   -> 40
 
Some succour yet they could afford;
And, such as storms allow,
   -> 132
 
Nor soon he felt his strength decline,
Or courage die away;
   -> 116
 
The cask, the coop, the floated cord,
Delay'd not to bestow.
   -> 36
